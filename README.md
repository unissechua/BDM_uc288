# Big Data Management and Analysis Coursework

This repository contains the assignments submitted as part of the requirements for the Big Data Management and Analysis course during the Summer 2018 semester at NYU CUSP.

## HW1
This contains tasks to test understanding of high-order functions (HOF), MapReduce and streaming.

## HW2
This contains a task to test the understading of Spark, specifically `pyspark`. It includes a notebook which was created to first understand the data and how to process it and a script that was successfully run on Hadoop.

## FinalChallenge
This contains the final challenge task which processes over 10 million geotagged tweets to check which tweets are potentially drug-related. A set of keywords was given to be compared to the tweets and the output should be a normalized count for each census tract of the 500 largest cities in the United States.
